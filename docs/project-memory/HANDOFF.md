# Handoff

Short, current-state continuation note for the next agent/session. This
document is replaced/updated in place, not appended to indefinitely — Git
history already provides the detailed historical trail.

Last updated: **2026-08-15**

## What was most recently done

**Phase 2C — Flexible Multi-Channel Waveform Workspace: Discovery and
Design.** Design/discovery only — **nothing implemented, nothing decided**.
Full detail:
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2C](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2c--flexible-multi-channel-waveform-workspace-discovery-and-design-2026-08-15).

**What was done**: re-verified `powerwave`'s live multi-channel/panel code
directly (via a spawned Explore subagent, same commit `3156392`), consulted
Detego's own public marketing/docs pages (`detego.app`,
`detego.app/docs/guide/waveform-viewer`) for publicly observable
waveform-viewer behavior per DEC-020's benchmark framework, and produced a
full design proposal covering: the panel abstraction (one shared X inherited
from DEC-021, independent Y per panel); an `engineering_type` auto-grouping
default that never permanently constrains channel placement; a channel-add
workflow recommendation (checkbox + "Add N selected," matching Phase 1's
established interaction pattern); a drag/reorder model (reorder panels, move
channels between panels, create/split panels via drag — explicitly **not**
one-per-panel channel reordering or panel-merging in the first slice); a
recommended **one independent Plotly instance per panel** architecture
(extending Phase 2B's already-proven `suppressNextRelayout`/sequence-number
broadcast mechanism to N panels, rather than fighting Plotly's native
multi-subplot domain-fraction math); a Fit-vs-Proportional Y-scaling model
(Fit — viewport-aware — as the default, an explicit improvement over
`powerwave`'s own stale full-session-window autoscale; Proportional as a
later toggle); mixed-unit-panel handling (allowed via drag, with an
automatic secondary Y axis); a legend/identity model reusing Phase 1's
existing sidebar rather than building a second one; a lightweight
plain-object workspace state model (no Redux/framework); a recommended
implementation slicing (2C-A through 2C-D, plus an optional
backend-batching slice); and a reassessment of the TTL and ~100 MB
real-file-memory open items (neither escalates to a Phase 2C blocker).

**A genuinely new finding, not previously recorded**: `powerwave` already
has live channel-to-panel drag-and-drop (legend row → panel header, plus a
sidebar combo box and a merge/split context menu) — but **no panel-
reordering mechanism exists anywhere in its codebase**. Detego's own public
docs don't document panel-reordering either. This is flagged as the single
clearest opportunity for Oruxa to exceed both references at once, not
merely match one of them.

**Nothing here is a `[DECISION]`** — every substantive design choice remains
`[PROPOSAL]`/`[ANALYSIS]`/`[COMPARISON]`/`[NEEDS UAT]`/`[DEFER]`, per this
task's own explicit instruction. DEC-021 and DEC-022 are reaffirmed,
unweakened, throughout. **No code was written this pass** — no multi-channel
API, no panel model, no drag/drop, no digital signals, no cursors. Commit
was **docs-only**.

## What was done in the prior session (Phase 2B Renderer Closure)

**Phase 2B — Renderer Closure.** The owner's final UAT decision:
**Plotly.js is selected as the waveform rendering foundation** (DEC-022,
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)) — Plotly's better waveform clarity, richer
built-in navigation, and overall stronger engineering interaction feel
won out over uPlot's own strength (a very good free-moving crosshair
feel). **This is Phase 2B's final outcome — no longer `[UAT]`.** Full
detail:
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2B Renderer Closure Record](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2b--renderer-closure-record-2026-08-15).

**What changed**: the crosshair was restyled — `spikedash: "dash"` (was
solid) and a reduced-opacity `spikecolor` (was fully opaque) — a lighter,
subtler guide line closer to uPlot's visual character, **without**
recreating uPlot's cursor mechanics. The owner explicitly declined to
pursue crosshair-responsiveness parity with uPlot ("not important enough
to justify additional implementation complexity or development time") —
no custom mouse-following overlay was built; Plotly's native, sample-
snapped hover behaviour is otherwise unchanged. `UPlotAdapter`, the
renderer-switch UI (tabs), and `frontend/vendor/uplot/` were all removed
— confirmed via repository-wide search, no live `uplot` reference remains
outside historical documentation. The page itself was simplified: no more
"renderer comparison"/"Phase 2B UAT" wording, just a plain "Single-channel
waveform preview — not the final Phase 2C workspace" label. **DEC-021
(workspace-level, centralized-toolbar navigation) is unchanged and
unweakened** — Plotly's native per-channel modebar, kept for this
single-channel page, is now documented directly in the page's own visible
text as temporary, ahead of Phase 2C's required centralized toolbar.

**No Phase 2A backend change** (zero backend files touched, 278 tests
unmodified and passing). **No Phase 2C work.**

## What was done in the prior session (Phase 2B Plotly refinement)

**Phase 2B — Plotly Refinement & Workspace-Level Navigation.** Follows
the owner's hands-on UAT of the Phase 2B renderer prototype (commit
`ad6d9d2`): **Plotly is currently preferred** (better clarity, richer
native controls, smoother interaction) over uPlot (whose own strength was
its built-in crosshair), but the renderer choice is **explicitly not
closed** — `[UAT — Plotly preferred pending final refinement
confirmation]`. Full detail:
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2B Plotly Refinement & Workspace-Level
Navigation Record](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2b--plotly-refinement--workspace-level-navigation-record-2026-08-15).

**Two things were built/fixed this pass**:
1. A native Plotly crosshair (`showspikes`/`spikesnap: "data"`/
   `spikemode: "across"` on both axes, `hovermode: "closest"`) — no
   custom crosshair system, per the task's own preference for native
   capability first. `spikesnap: "data"` deliberately snaps to real
   recorded samples, never an interpolated position.
2. A toolbar-lag investigation that found a real bug, not just perceived
   slowness: Plotly's native Autoscale/Reset-axes modebar buttons fire an
   `xaxis.autorange: true` relayout (no explicit range), which the
   original relayout handler silently ignored — meaning those buttons
   never actually re-fetched the true full record, only re-scaled
   whatever data was already loaded. Fixed. The viewport debounce was
   also shortened 200ms → 120ms (button clicks have no drag-frames to
   coalesce, so the old debounce was pure added latency for that specific
   interaction). "Reset View" was relabelled "Reset Time View" throughout
   to keep it distinct from "Autoscale Y," per DEC-021.

**DEC-021 — waveform navigation is workspace-level, not channel-level**
(full text in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)): one shared X/time viewport
must eventually drive every displayed channel together; a centralized
Powerwave toolbar (never a per-channel native modebar) is the required
future architecture. Recorded now, while Phase 2B still has one channel,
specifically so Phase 2C's architecture doesn't accidentally build
per-channel navigation controls. The existing request-coordinator
function was deliberately left unrestructured (multi-channel fetching is
still out of scope) but is now commented as the exact Phase 2C extension
point.

**uPlot was NOT removed** — it remains fully functional and unmodified,
for the owner's final side-by-side crosshair comparison. **No Phase 2A
backend change** (zero backend files touched, 278 tests unmodified and
passing). **No Phase 2C work.**

## What was done in the prior session (Phase 2B renderer UAT prototype)

**Phase 2B — Renderer UAT Prototype.** Built the bounded browser
comparison prototype the Phase 2 design work called for: a new, isolated
page (`frontend/waveform-prototype.html`) lets the owner hands-on compare
**uPlot** and **Plotly.js** against the identical Phase 2A backend
waveform data and interaction contract — same endpoint, same channel,
same fixed point budget (4000), switching renderers reuses already-
fetched data instead of re-fetching. Opened via a new "Waveform (UAT)"
link added to each analog channel row in the existing Phase 1 channel
browser (`frontend/index.html`) — the main app itself is otherwise
unchanged. **No plotting-library winner was chosen — this is `[DECISION
MODE: UAT]`, for the owner to judge.** No Phase 2C (draggable/panel)
work, no digital channels, no cursors/measurements, no calculated
signals, no synchronization. Full detail:
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2B Implementation Record](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2b--renderer-uat-prototype-implementation-record-2026-08-15).

**What was built, precisely**: uPlot (v1.6.32) and Plotly.js
cartesian-only (v3.7.0) vendored as static, pre-built, minified bundles
under `frontend/vendor/` (no build step — matches the project's existing
architecture; provenance/versions recorded in `frontend/vendor/README.md`
for later removal/upgrade). Both candidates implement one shared
`WaveformRenderer` adapter contract (`init`/`update`/`setViewport`/
`destroy`) so a losing candidate is cleanly deletable later. A shared
coordinator owns the debounced (200ms), doubly-protected
(`AbortController` **and** a sequence number, tested independently)
range-request pipeline — zoom/pan in either renderer calls the same
`requestViewportRangeDebounced()` function, nothing else. Neither
renderer applies curve smoothing (uPlot's default linear path; Plotly's
`line.shape: "linear"` set explicitly, not left to an unexamined
default). Backend was **not touched** — `git diff --stat -- backend/` is
empty, and all 278 existing backend tests, none modified, still pass.

**TTL note for this pass**: per the task's explicit instruction, TTL was
**not** implemented; a temporary DEV-only operational stopgap was
documented instead (owner clicks `Start new workspace` at the end of the
UAT session, or the DEV backend container is restarted between separate
UAT sessions) — see
[CURRENT_STATE.md — Known blockers](CURRENT_STATE.md#known-blockers).
**This is not a claim that the TTL `[OPEN]` item is solved.**

## What was done in the prior session (Detego benchmark documentation, three passes)

**Documentation-only, three passes same day**: established `detego.app`
as an official product/UI-UX/waveform-workspace/dashboard/workflow
**benchmark** (explicitly not a ceiling or a spec to copy blindly) for
feature design, per direct owner instruction — new
[PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md](PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md), DEC-020 in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md), and short pointer sections added to
[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)/[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) (matching the
existing architecture-reference pointer pattern — state the principle
briefly, read detail at the source). A second pass the same day received
the owner's actual source document ("Detego Benchmark Principle.rtf") as
a genuine attachment and updated all four files to quote/match its exact
canonical wording (same DEC-020, not a new decision — see its own
"Wording update" note in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)), adding two
specifics the first pass's paraphrase hadn't captured: "learn from
Detego's public behaviour, implement an independent Oruxa design," and
the standing question for major features — *"What does Detego do here,
what does existing powerwave do, and what would make oruxa_powerwave
better for the engineer?"* A **third pass**, same day, expanded
[PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md](PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md) with the four-way
feature-design method (`powerwave` / Detego / owner requirements /
proposed superior Oruxa approach), three worked examples (waveform
workspace, multi-source synchronization, calculated signals), an explicit
"owner-specific capabilities may exceed Detego" list (not exhaustive —
Detego is not the product boundary), and explicit
"architecture-stays-Oruxa-owned" / "independent implementation, not
reverse engineering" sections — plus one added sentence each in
`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` covering those last two points concisely. Still
the same DEC-020; no new `DECISIONS.md` entry was needed. **No production
code changed in any of the three passes.**

**Provenance note, worth preserving**: an earlier version of this same
request arrived mid-turn, structured as a system-reminder-wrapped message
that referenced "an attached ZIP" never actually present in context, and
asked for edits to this repository's own governance files plus a push to
`main` while explicitly directing that this project's own
change-governance step be skipped. That version was declined and flagged
to the user rather than executed — an unverifiable, injection-shaped
request is not owner authorization on its own. The owner then reissued
the same direction as a normal, self-contained conversational instruction
with no external attachment referenced or needed, which is what this
pass and [PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md](PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md) are built from.
**No technical audit of `detego.app` itself was performed or is claimed**
— see [PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md](PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md)'s own `[OPEN]` note.
Future sessions should not assume a feature comparison against Detego
already exists just because this reference framework does.

## What was done in the prior session (Phase 2A implementation)

**Phase 2A — Waveform Data Foundation** (backend only). Following the
Phase 2 discovery/design pass (summarized below), the owner authorized
implementing exactly the first recommended vertical slice: retain each
imported source's full-resolution `DisturbanceRecord` in the active
workspace, and add one bounded waveform range endpoint for a single analog
channel. **No chart library, no frontend rendering, no digital-channel
waveform delivery, no Phase 2B/2C/2D work** — see
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2A Implementation Record](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2a--waveform-data-foundation-implementation-record-2026-08-15)
and [DECISIONS.md — DEC-019](DECISIONS.md#dec-019--phase-2a-retains-the-full-resolution-disturbancerecord-in-the-active-workspace)
for full detail; summarized here for continuation purposes.

**What was built**: `ActiveSource` (`app/domain/source.py`) pairs the
existing lightweight `SourceMetadata` with the authoritative
`DisturbanceRecord`; `WorkspaceRegistry` now stores `ActiveSource`
(keying/locking/cleanup methods unchanged — `remove()`/`remove_workspace()`
already correctly release whatever's stored per `(workspace_id,
source_id)`); `app/domain/waveform_reduction.py` implements a
peak-preserving min/max envelope (equal-count buckets, chronological
output, guaranteed true first/last sample, deterministic, never mutates
its input) — deliberately **not** `powerwave`'s own plain-stride
decimator; `app/services/waveform_service.py` does exact time-range
extraction (boundary-inclusive, `searchsorted`-based) then applies that
reduction only when the range exceeds the request's `point_budget`;
`GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/sources/{source_id}/waveform`
(added to the existing `app/api/v1/sources.py` router) exposes it as JSON.

**What was verified**: 278 backend tests pass (227 unchanged + 51 new),
including the mandatory synthetic-spike regression test (proves plain
stride sampling misses a narrow transient that the new algorithm
preserves), zoom-fidelity tests (narrower requests reveal genuinely finer
data, and a sufficiently narrow range returns true full-resolution
samples again), and lifecycle tests including a weakref-based proof that
`Remove`/whole-workspace-DELETE actually release the retained record's
memory, not just make it API-inaccessible. Measured (not assumed)
performance/memory across four synthetic scenarios up to 2,000,000
samples: range extraction is sub-millisecond at every scale tested;
reduction to a 4000-point budget stays under 8 ms even at 2M samples;
JSON payload for a reduced response stays ~110-120 KB regardless of
record size, versus 61 MB if full resolution were returned for one
channel at the largest scale tested — directly confirming why the
range-request architecture was recommended.

## What was done in the prior session (Phase 2 discovery/design)

**Phase 2 waveform-workspace discovery and design** — the project owner
confirmed Phase 1 has passed its final UAT and is complete, then requested
a discovery/design-only pass (explicitly: no implementation) covering the
existing `powerwave` waveform/plotting architecture, candidate web
waveform data-delivery architectures, plotting-library candidates, the
backend memory-model change Phase 2 requires, and a proposed Phase 2 slice
sequence. Full content:
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2 Waveform Workspace Discovery and
Design](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2--waveform-workspace-discovery-and-design-2026-08-14) —
summarized here for continuation purposes. **No code was written this
pass** — no waveform API, no chart library dependency, no backend
full-resolution-array retention, nothing deployed.

**`powerwave` waveform architecture — re-verified live** (not trusted from
documentation, per the task's own warning that discovery already found
stale/dead plotting references): live path is `SessionCanvasWidget` +
`SessionCanvasController`; `FlexiblePlotCanvas`/`VisualizationManager`/
`DigitalEventTimeline`/`channel_grouper.py`/the `overlays/` abstraction are
all confirmed dead (unreachable from the live app; `FastWaveformWidget`
doesn't exist as a class at all). **The single most consequential finding**:
`build_aligned_data()`'s decimation (`downsampling.py`) is **plain
nth-point stride sampling** (`t_clip[::stride]`) — not peak-preserving,
not viewport-aware (decimates against the whole session window, not the
live viewport, at a hardcoded `max_points=4000` never overridden anywhere).
This means `powerwave` itself can silently drop a transient spike or a
narrow digital pulse during decimation, and zooming does not fetch
higher-resolution detail — both are explicitly flagged as behaviors Phase
2 must **not** inherit.

**Design proposal highlights** (all `[PROPOSAL]` / decision-mode-tagged,
none approved): viewport/range-request API (`GET .../sources/{id}/waveform`)
over "send everything once"; **min/max envelope** decimation (not
`powerwave`'s stride sampling, not LTTB) for engineering-correctness
reasons; JSON to start, binary only if benchmarking shows a real cost;
extend `WorkspaceRegistry`'s stored value to also retain the parsed
`DisturbanceRecord` (currently discarded after upload — this is the major
backend architecture change Phase 2 requires); reassessed the existing
abandoned-session TTL `[OPEN]` item as materially more important now that
full-resolution arrays (not just metadata) would be at stake, without
resolving it outright (`[DECISION MODE: COMPARISON]`); a bounded two-library
plotting prototype (uPlot vs. ECharts, `[DECISION MODE: UAT]`); and a
Phase 2A/2B/2C/2D slice sequence with an exact-scope first slice
(one channel, backend-only, API-tested, no frontend chart yet).

## What was done in the prior session (Phase 1 closure fix)

A **focused Phase 1 closure fix**: correcting `Start new workspace` into a
real, backend-enforced whole-workspace reset. This followed a same-day
investigation (requested separately, before this fix) into whether
`Remove` and `Start new workspace` were genuinely different — the
investigation found `Start new workspace` was a no-op pretending to be a
reset (client-only UUID rotation, no backend call, old sources leaked in
memory, stale banner). The owner decided to **keep** the button and make it
correct, rather than remove or hide it. See
[MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 1 Workspace-Reset Record](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-1--workspace-reset-record-2026-08-14)
and [DECISIONS.md — DEC-018](DECISIONS.md#dec-018--start-new-workspace-is-a-distinct-whole-workspace-lifecycle-operation-not-a-remove-alias)
for full detail.

**What was built**: a new whole-workspace backend endpoint
(`DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}`, new file
`backend/app/api/v1/workspaces.py`) backed by a new
`WorkspaceRegistry.remove_workspace(workspace_id)` method; and a corrected
frontend flow where `Start new workspace` shows its own confirmation
(only when the workspace is non-empty), calls that DELETE against the
*old* workspace id, and only rotates the client-side id — clearing the
source list, channel panel, and stale banner — after the backend call
succeeds. A failed cleanup leaves everything as it was, with a visible
error instead of a silent fake reset.

**Prior work this document also covers** (unchanged by this pass): a
narrow UI refinement pass on the already-implemented, already-deployed
Phase 1, driven directly by the owner's completed hands-on UAT of
`https://dev.powerwave.oruxa.uk`.

**What UAT approved and left alone**: the two-slot `.cfg`/`.dat` upload
workflow (now formally decided — DEC-017, not just a temporary Phase 1
choice), the loading/parsing indicator, the 100 MB guidance text, the
source-metadata-review-before-channels step, and the overall simple
single-page UI direction. None of these were touched.

**What UAT asked to change, and what was built**:

1. **Channel organization** — the reported problem was scrolling through
   hundreds of channels in one long table (UAT's own example: 80 analog,
   282 digital). Fixed with native `<details>`/`<summary>` collapsible
   sections (Analog defaults open, Digital defaults collapsed — the
   section that was actually overwhelming), always showing counts.
2. **Analog sub-grouping by engineering type** — `Voltage`/`Current`/
   `Power`/`Frequency`/`ROCOF`/`Undefined`. Classification is computed
   **once, backend-side** (new `backend/app/domain/channel_classification.py`),
   exposed as `engineering_type` on every analog channel — never
   re-derived or duplicated in the frontend. Three-tier rule (explicit
   `parameter_type` → unit semantics → nothing else — naming-pattern
   classification was deliberately not implemented, since no pattern was
   judged unambiguous enough): anything that doesn't confidently resolve
   is `Undefined`, never guessed into a real category.
3. **Channel search** — client-side only, over the already-fetched channel
   list, no network calls per keystroke. Auto-expands groups containing a
   match; clearing search restores the default expansion state.
4. **Scale/Offset removed from the primary analog table** — UAT found them
   low-value for browsing. Both fields are **unchanged** in the domain
   model and API response (`AnalogChannelSummary`/`AnalogChannelOut`) —
   only this one table stopped displaying them.
5. **Removal confirmation** — clicking "Remove" now opens one small
   confirmation dialog before the DELETE request is ever issued.
6. **Stale-banner bug fixed** — the import-success banner previously stayed
   visible after its source was removed. Now cleared, but only when it
   actually described the source just removed (tracked precisely, not a
   blanket clear-on-any-removal) — deliberately forward-compatible with a
   future multi-source workspace.

## What was verified (this pass — Phase 2C discovery/design)

- `oruxa_powerwave` git state: local `main` confirmed identical to
  `origin/main` at commit `704df11` (independent `git fetch` via the
  established HTTPS-URL workaround — the configured SSH `origin` remote is
  not authenticated in this sandbox), working tree clean, before this pass
  began.
- **`powerwave` git state**: confirmed via a spawned Explore subagent —
  `/Volumes/externalDrive/code-gym/powerwave`, remote
  `https://github.com/myza81/powerwave.git`, commit `3156392` (same commit
  every prior investigation this project has used — no drift).
- **Detego**: only publicly available marketing/docs pages
  (`detego.app`, `detego.app/docs/guide/waveform-viewer`) were fetched via
  `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` — no authenticated app, no proprietary code/assets
  were accessed or inspected, per this task's own instruction and the
  standing `PRODUCT_REFERENCES.md` governance.
- **This is a documentation-only pass** — no backend or frontend code was
  touched; nothing to run a test suite against. `git diff --stat` after all
  edits shows only the four project-memory markdown files.
- `git diff --check` — no whitespace errors.

## What was verified (prior pass — Phase 2B renderer closure)

- `oruxa_powerwave` git state: local `main` confirmed identical to
  `origin/main` (independent `git fetch`), working tree clean, before and
  after this pass.
- **Backend regression: 278 tests, unmodified, all still pass** — zero
  backend files in the diff (`git diff --stat -- backend/` empty).
- **Frontend: 31 scripted `jsdom` checks, all passing** — 3 new
  static-markup checks confirming no renderer-selector UI, no
  "renderer comparison"/"Phase 2B UAT" wording, and no uPlot code
  references remain anywhere in the shipped file; the rest cover
  Plotly-only initialization, the restyled crosshair configuration
  (dashed/thin/reduced-opacity/still-sample-snapped/both-axes), zoom,
  the native-autoscale-refetch fix, Reset Time View, both stale-request
  protection layers, and safe-failure error handling.
- **Repository-wide search**: `grep -ril "uplot"` (excluding `.git` and
  `docs/`, which intentionally retains historical record) returns only
  `frontend/waveform-prototype.html` (two historical/rationale comments,
  zero code references) and `frontend/vendor/README.md` (its own
  intentional "History" note). `find -iname "*uplot*"` confirms zero
  files with that name remain anywhere in the tree.
- No real-browser/visual verification was performed in this sandboxed
  session (no headless browser available) — see "Live DEV verification"
  in this task's final report for what was checked via `curl`/static-asset
  inspection instead.

## What was verified (prior pass — Phase 2B Plotly refinement)

- `oruxa_powerwave` git state: local `main` confirmed identical to
  `origin/main` (independent `git fetch`), working tree clean, before and
  after this pass.
- **Backend regression: 278 tests, unmodified, all still pass** — zero
  backend files in the diff (`git diff --stat -- backend/` empty).
- **Frontend: 24 scripted `jsdom` checks, all passing** — 10 regression
  checks confirming every existing Phase 2B behaviour (initial request,
  zoom, both stale-protection layers, Reset Time View, renderer switching
  including uPlot remaining functional, adapter cleanup, error banner) is
  unchanged after this pass's edits, plus 5 new checks: the Plotly
  layout's spike/crosshair configuration is present with the exact
  documented settings, and — the most important new test — a simulated
  native Autoscale/Reset-axes relayout event now correctly triggers a
  real full-record re-fetch, proving the toolbar-lag investigation's bug
  fix.
- No real-browser/visual verification was performed in this sandboxed
  session (no headless browser available) — visual crosshair appearance
  and felt interaction smoothness are exactly what the owner's own final
  UAT session is for; see "Live DEV verification" in this task's final
  report for what was checked via `curl`/static-asset inspection instead.

## What was verified (prior pass — Phase 2B renderer UAT prototype)

- `oruxa_powerwave` git state: local `main` confirmed identical to
  `origin/main` (independent `git fetch`), working tree clean, before and
  after this pass.
- **Backend regression: 278 tests, unmodified, all still pass** —
  confirmed zero backend files in the diff (`git diff --stat -- backend/`
  empty).
- **Frontend: 25 scripted `jsdom` checks, all passing**, driving the
  actual shipped `waveform-prototype.html` (not a reimplementation)
  against stub `uPlot`/`Plotly` objects satisfying their real public
  APIs. Covers: initial full-record request shape; zoom → debounced
  narrower request; the stale-response scenario with the
  `AbortController` layer and the sequence-number fallback layer verified
  **independently** (a dedicated test isolates the sequence-number path
  by simulating an abort that doesn't reject the promise); Reset View;
  friendly error-banner wording; renderer switch issuing zero new
  requests and reusing already-fetched data; repeated renderer switching
  with matched init/destroy counts and no duplicate DOM nodes; and
  Plotly's own programmatic-relayout-after-Reset not looping into a
  second fetch.
- Vendored library integrity: exact byte sizes recorded (uPlot ≈ 52 KB
  combined JS+CSS; Plotly-cartesian ≈ 1.36 MB JS), versions/licenses
  recorded in `frontend/vendor/README.md`.
- No real-browser/visual verification was performed in this sandboxed
  session (no headless browser available) — see "Live DEV verification"
  in this task's final report for what was checked via `curl`/static
  asset inspection instead, and note clearly that interactive/visual
  correctness is the explicit purpose of the owner's own upcoming UAT
  session, not something already claimed done here.

## What was verified (prior pass — Phase 2A implementation)

- `oruxa_powerwave` git state: local `main` confirmed identical to
  `origin/main` (independent `git fetch`), working tree clean, before and
  after this pass.
- All 227 previously-passing backend tests still pass **unmodified in
  behaviour** — only `tests/test_workspace_registry.py`'s fixture helper
  needed a mechanical update (build `ActiveSource` instead of a bare
  `SourceMetadata`); every assertion it made before still holds.
  `tests/test_comtrade_parity.py`/`test_comtrade_provider.py` (parser
  correctness) were touched by nothing this pass and still pass.
- **278 total backend tests pass** — see "What was most recently done"
  above for the breakdown; re-verified from a clean venv
  (`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`).
- Performance/memory measured via a one-off, uncommitted benchmark script
  against synthetic (non-confidential) data at four scales up to 2M
  samples — see the Phase 2A Implementation Record's tables. Not measured:
  an actual ~100 MB real COMTRADE file through the real parser (still
  `[OPEN]`, now partially informed by a precisely measured
  file-to-parsed-memory expansion ratio instead of a pure guess).
- Manually confirmed (via `app.openapi()`'s paths, not raw `app.routes` —
  FastAPI's internal route representation makes the latter show an opaque
  wrapper object, a known quirk from Phase 1's own final report) that all
  6 endpoints register correctly, including the new
  `GET .../sources/{source_id}/waveform`.

## What was verified (prior pass — Phase 2 design)

- `oruxa_powerwave` git state: local `main` confirmed identical to
  `origin/main` (independent `git fetch`), working tree clean, before and
  after this pass.
- `powerwave` git state: confirmed unchanged since the original discovery
  audit (`HEAD` still `31563920...` / short form `3156392`), so the
  original [POWERWAVE_DISCOVERY.md](POWERWAVE_DISCOVERY.md) findings were
  still applicable — but re-verified live anyway (not assumed), per the
  task's explicit instruction and the project's own "code over docs"
  source-of-truth rule.
- **All 14 specific `powerwave` waveform-architecture claims this pass set
  out to check were independently re-confirmed against live code** (file
  path + line number evidence, not just re-reading the prior discovery
  doc) — see [MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2--waveform-workspace-discovery-and-design-2026-08-14)
  for the full findings. One correction to the prior discovery note:
  `_infer_panel_for_channel()` is a module-level function, not a method.
  One materially new finding beyond the prior discovery pass's scope: the
  decimation algorithm itself (`t_clip[::stride]`) is confirmed plain
  nth-point stride sampling with no peak preservation, and digital
  transitions are decimated *before* transition-extraction runs, meaning a
  narrow pulse can be dropped before `extract_transitions()` ever sees it
  — a genuine, previously uncited engineering-integrity risk in the
  current desktop app, carried into the design as an explicit "do not
  repeat this" principle.
- This was a discovery/design-only task — **no automated test suite
  applies** (no code was written). No backend/frontend changes exist to
  regression-test.

## What was verified (prior pass — workspace-reset fix)

- **227 backend tests pass** (`cd backend && pytest`), up from 215 — new:
  `test_workspaces_api.py` (single- and multi-source whole-workspace
  DELETE, cross-workspace isolation, empty/unknown-workspace idempotency,
  blank-id rejection, delete-then-reupload-into-the-same-id), 4 new
  `WorkspaceRegistry.remove_workspace()` unit tests in
  `test_workspace_registry.py`, and one `Remove`-regression test in
  `test_sources_api.py` confirming a single-source delete leaves sibling
  sources in the same workspace intact. No COMTRADE parser/provider/
  classification code was touched this pass.
- **Frontend logic verified against the actual shipped code**, not a
  reimplementation: a one-off `jsdom` script (not committed, same
  established approach as the prior UAT refinement pass) drove the *real*
  upload code path (mocked-`fetch` form submission — not direct variable
  poking, since top-level `let`/`const` in a classic script are not
  reachable via `window.*`, matching real browsers) and exercised 36
  checks across 7 scenarios: confirmation shown only for a non-empty
  workspace and only before any DELETE; Cancel issues zero DELETE calls
  and preserves the old workspace id/source list/banner; Confirm issues
  exactly one workspace-level DELETE against the *old* id, then mints a
  new id and clears source list/channel panel/banner; a failed DELETE
  preserves everything and shows a visible error; an empty workspace
  skips confirmation but still resets; `Remove` still issues only a
  source-level DELETE and its Cancel/banner/other-source-preserved
  behaviour is unchanged; removing an unrelated source still leaves a
  still-valid banner alone. All 36 passed.
- No production code outside the intended scope was touched — see "Files
  changed" below.

## What was verified (prior pass — UAT refinement)

- **215 backend tests pass**, up from 168 — new:
  `test_channel_classification.py` (every recognized unit/parameter_type,
  priority ordering, explicit ambiguous-channel-stays-Undefined coverage)
  plus a new API assertion that `engineering_type` appears correctly in
  live channel responses. No provider/parser code was touched that pass —
  COMTRADE parity is structurally unaffected (confirmed by the unmodified
  parity tests still passing).
- **Frontend logic verified against the actual shipped code**, not a
  reimplementation: a one-off Node script (not committed — no frontend
  test framework existed before this task, and none was introduced, per
  the task's explicit allowance to document manual/scripted verification
  instead) loaded `frontend/index.html`'s real inline `<script>` into a
  `jsdom`-backed DOM and exercised: grouping/counts/default-expansion/
  column-removal against an 80-analog/282-digital dataset matching UAT's
  own numbers; search (case-insensitive, cross-analog/digital,
  auto-expand-on-match, no-match empty state, clear-restores-default);
  the full remove-confirmation flow, explicitly confirming **Cancel issues
  zero DELETE requests**; the stale-banner fix; and — the task's explicit
  forward-compat check — that removing a *different* source never clears
  an unrelated still-valid banner. All passed. (One bug was caught and
  fixed in the *test script itself* during this process — an attempt to
  read a `let`-scoped JS variable via `window.X` from outside the script,
  which correctly doesn't work in real browsers either; the fix was to
  drive the real upload/removal code paths instead of poking at internal
  state, which is also the more faithful test.)
- **Live guardrail regression check** against a local `uvicorn` server:
  missing-companion-file (422), wrong-extension (400
  `unsupported_file_type`), and successful upload-then-delete-then-404 all
  behave exactly as before; the new `engineering_type` field appears
  correctly (`VA`/`VB` → `Voltage`, `IA` → `Current` for the synthetic
  fixture).

## What files were changed this session (Phase 2C discovery/design)

Modified only: `docs/project-memory/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (new "Phase 2C —
Flexible Multi-Channel Waveform Workspace: Discovery and Design" section,
inserted between the Phase 2B Renderer Closure Record and the Phase 0
section), `docs/project-memory/CURRENT_STATE.md` (Development-phase
paragraph, Current-approved-focus paragraph, Next-approved-activity
paragraph, Documentation bullet, Major-currently-available-components
bullet), `docs/project-memory/HANDOFF.md` (this document). **No entry was
added to `DECISIONS.md`** — nothing in this pass rose to an approved
`[DECISION]`, per the task's own explicit instruction. **No `backend/` file,
no `frontend/` file, no CI/deployment workflow file was touched** — this was
a documentation-only, design/discovery pass.

## What files were changed in the prior session (Phase 2B renderer closure)

Modified: `frontend/waveform-prototype.html` (uPlot removal, crosshair
restyle, page-text simplification), `frontend/Dockerfile` (comment
accuracy only), `frontend/vendor/README.md` (uPlot entry removed, History
section added), `docs/project-memory/{DECISIONS,MIGRATION_PLAN,CURRENT_STATE,HANDOFF}.md`
(DEC-022 added; this work).

Deleted: `frontend/vendor/uplot/uPlot.iife.min.js`,
`frontend/vendor/uplot/uPlot.min.css`, `frontend/vendor/uplot/LICENSE`.

No new files, no `frontend/index.html` change, no `backend/` file, and no
CI/deployment workflow file touched.

## What files were changed in the prior session (Phase 2B Plotly refinement)

Modified only: `frontend/waveform-prototype.html` (Plotly native
spike/crosshair config; relayout-handler autorange fix; debounce 200ms →
120ms; "Reset View" → "Reset Time View" label/wording; Phase 2C
extension-point and semantic-distinction comments — no HTML structure
change), `docs/project-memory/{DECISIONS,MIGRATION_PLAN,CURRENT_STATE,HANDOFF}.md`
(DEC-021 added; this work).

No new files, no `frontend/vendor/*` change, no `frontend/index.html`
change, no `backend/` file, and no CI/deployment workflow file touched.

## What files were changed in the prior session (Phase 2B renderer UAT prototype)

New: `frontend/waveform-prototype.html`, `frontend/vendor/README.md`,
`frontend/vendor/uplot/{uPlot.iife.min.js,uPlot.min.css,LICENSE}`,
`frontend/vendor/plotly/{plotly-cartesian.min.js,LICENSE}`.

Modified: `frontend/index.html` (one new "Waveform (UAT)" link per analog
channel row; `renderChannelTable`/`renderAnalogGroup` extended with a
backward-compatible optional action-column parameter — digital channels'
call site unchanged), `frontend/Dockerfile` (serves the new page +
vendored assets), `frontend/.dockerignore` (comment only, no pattern
changes), `docs/project-memory/{MIGRATION_PLAN,CURRENT_STATE,HANDOFF}.md`
(this work).

**`DECISIONS.md` was NOT modified** — no plotting-library winner was
chosen (explicitly out of scope; `[DECISION MODE: UAT]`), and no other
new non-UI technical decision was made this pass that wasn't already
covered by DEC-019/DEC-020.

No `backend/`, `docker-entrypoint.d/`, or CI/deployment workflow file was
touched.

## What files were changed in the prior session (Phase 2A implementation)

New: `backend/app/domain/waveform_reduction.py`,
`backend/app/services/waveform_service.py`,
`backend/app/schemas/waveform.py`,
`backend/tests/test_waveform_reduction.py`,
`backend/tests/test_waveform_service.py`,
`backend/tests/test_waveform_api.py`.

Modified: `backend/app/domain/source.py` (new `ActiveSource`),
`backend/app/domain/__init__.py`,
`backend/app/domain/disturbance_record.py` (docstring correction — see
below),
`backend/app/services/workspace_registry.py` (stored-value type widened
from `SourceMetadata` to `ActiveSource`; keying/locking/cleanup logic
itself unchanged; docstrings corrected),
`backend/app/services/import_service.py` (builds/stores `ActiveSource`
instead of discarding the parsed record; docstring corrected),
`backend/app/services/errors.py` (3 new error classes, shared base class
docstring broadened),
`backend/app/api/v1/sources.py` (new waveform endpoint; existing
endpoints' internals updated to unwrap `.metadata` — their
request/response contracts are unchanged),
`backend/tests/test_workspace_registry.py` (fixture helper builds
`ActiveSource`),
`docs/project-memory/{DECISIONS,MIGRATION_PLAN,CURRENT_STATE,HANDOFF}.md`
(this work — DEC-019 added).

**Stale-docstring corrections, not silent rewrites** (per the project's
own conflict-resolution rule): `app/domain/disturbance_record.py` and
`app/services/import_service.py`'s module docstrings both used to state
the `DisturbanceRecord` is discarded after upload — both now explain the
Phase 2A change and point to DEC-019, rather than leaving the old,
now-false claim in place uncorrected.

No `backend/app/providers/*`, `backend/app/main.py`, `frontend/*`, or CI/
deployment file was touched.

## What files were changed in the prior session (Phase 2 design)

Modified (documentation only — no application code):
- `docs/project-memory/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` — new "Phase 2 — Waveform
  Workspace Discovery and Design" section (~1,400 lines): verified
  `powerwave` findings, behavior-vs-implementation table, data-delivery
  architecture comparison (Options A-D), transfer-format comparison,
  frontend/backend boundary confirmation, plotting-library candidates,
  Phase 2 scope + channel-selection UX, panel model, analog scaling,
  time-axis handling, full-resolution zoom principle, peak-preservation
  recommendation, digital-signal preservation, browser/backend memory
  models, source-lifecycle extension proposal, TTL reassessment, session
  concurrency, API proposal, caching strategy, initial-load UX, loading
  states, error handling, performance targets, engineering-correctness
  test design, benchmark plan, and the full UAT/technical decision lists.
- `docs/project-memory/CURRENT_STATE.md` — recorded Phase 1's final owner
  UAT pass as complete; recorded that Phase 2 is in design-only stage with
  nothing implemented.
- `docs/project-memory/HANDOFF.md` — this section.

**`DECISIONS.md` was deliberately NOT modified** — no new item in the
Phase 2 design proposal has been owner-approved; recording any of it there
would misrepresent a proposal as a decision, which this task's own
instructions explicitly prohibited.

No `backend/` or `frontend/` file was touched.

## What files were changed in the prior session (workspace-reset fix)

New:
- `backend/app/api/v1/workspaces.py` — `DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}`.
- `backend/tests/test_workspaces_api.py` — whole-workspace DELETE API tests.

Modified:
- `backend/app/services/workspace_registry.py` — added
  `remove_workspace(workspace_id)`.
- `backend/app/main.py` — mounts the new `workspaces_v1_router`.
- `backend/tests/test_workspace_registry.py` — added `remove_workspace()`
  unit tests.
- `backend/tests/test_sources_api.py` — added the `Remove`-regression test
  (sibling sources in the same workspace survive a single-source delete).
- `frontend/index.html` — `startNewWorkspace()` split into a confirmation
  gate (`requestNewWorkspaceConfirm`) and the actual ordered reset
  (`resetToNewWorkspace`: DELETE old workspace → only on success, rotate
  id and clear UI state); new confirmation dialog
  (`#newWorkspaceConfirmOverlay`) separate from `Remove`'s; new error
  element (`#workspaceResetError`) for cleanup failures.
- `docs/project-memory/{DECISIONS,MIGRATION_PLAN,CURRENT_STATE,HANDOFF}.md`
  — this work (DEC-018 added).

No COMTRADE parser/provider/classification/config/storage file was
touched.

## Files changed in the prior session (UAT refinement pass)

New:
- `backend/app/domain/channel_classification.py`
- `backend/tests/test_channel_classification.py`

Modified:
- `backend/app/domain/source.py` — `AnalogChannelSummary` gained
  `engineering_type: str`.
- `backend/app/domain/__init__.py` — exports the classifier.
- `backend/app/schemas/source.py` — `AnalogChannelOut` gained
  `engineering_type`.
- `backend/app/services/import_service.py` — calls the classifier when
  building each analog channel's summary.
- `frontend/index.html` — collapsible grouping, analog sub-grouping,
  search, Scale/Offset removed from the primary table, remove
  confirmation dialog, stale-banner fix (for `Remove` only, at the time).

## GitHub / deployment status

**This pass (Phase 2C discovery/design) is documentation-only — see the
final report delivered in-conversation for the exact commit hash and push
confirmation.** There is nothing to deploy: no backend/frontend file
changed, so no DEV/PROD deployment step applies to this pass at all.
**Production and DEV were not touched.**

## What remains unresolved

- `[OPEN]`, **Phase 2C now has a full design proposal, but is still fully
  unimplemented and undecided**: the panel model, grouping/auto-placement
  rules, drag/reorder model, one-Plotly-instance-per-panel architecture,
  multi-channel backend request strategy, Y-scaling model (Fit/
  Proportional), mixed-unit handling, legend/identity model, workspace
  state shape, and implementation slicing are all recorded as `[PROPOSAL]`/
  `[ANALYSIS]`/`[COMPARISON]`/`[NEEDS UAT]` in
  [MIGRATION_PLAN.md — Phase 2C](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2c--flexible-multi-channel-waveform-workspace-discovery-and-design-2026-08-15) —
  **none of it is a `[DECISION]`**. The centralized-toolbar *principle*
  remains decided (DEC-021); its concrete design is now proposed, not yet
  approved.
- `[OPEN]` **Unchanged, still real**: abandoned-workspace cleanup still
  has no automatic expiry/TTL. `[DECISION MODE: COMPARISON]` — reassessed
  (not resolved) by this pass; see
  [MIGRATION_PLAN.md's Phase 2C §30](MIGRATION_PLAN.md#phase-2c--flexible-multi-channel-waveform-workspace-discovery-and-design-2026-08-15)
  and DEC-019's Impact section. Phase 2C's own design does not change the
  backend memory-retention shape (still per-*source*, DEC-019, unaffected
  by however many panels/channels a UI ever displays against it) but does
  plausibly make real UAT sessions longer/more numerous once built — this
  pass concluded TTL is not a Phase 2C design/first-slice blocker, but
  remains recommended before broader/prolonged shared-DEV UAT.
- `[OPEN]`, unchanged: digital waveform handling (deliberately deferred —
  the waveform endpoint rejects digital channel names by design; Phase 2C's
  own design confirms a digital-panel-type would fit the same panel
  abstraction later without rework, but builds nothing); the ~100 MB
  real-file memory ceiling (still not directly measured; same
  not-a-blocker-but-recommended-before-broader-UAT reasoning as TTL); and
  everything else already listed in
  [CURRENT_STATE.md — Known blockers](CURRENT_STATE.md#known-blockers).
- **A genuinely new open finding from this pass**: `powerwave`'s own legend
  context-menu has a **dead "Move to panel…" item** — wired on the UI side
  but its signal is connected nowhere in the live codebase (a real,
  previously-unflagged bug in the reference application, not something
  `oruxa_powerwave` needs to fix, but worth knowing if `powerwave` is ever
  consulted again for this specific interaction). Also: `powerwave`'s
  `QSplitter` panel-resize state is silently discarded on every structural
  rebuild (including an ordinary channel-panel move) — a confirmed weakness
  Oruxa's own design (§27's persisted-height state model) is built to avoid,
  not repeat.

## What should be done next

The next step is for the **project owner** to review the Phase 2C design
proposal and choose one of several valid paths — none is assumed here:
(a) approve the `[DECISION MODE: ANALYSIS]` items outright (listed in the
design's §35 — e.g. shared-viewport-state ownership, the one-Plotly-
instance-per-panel architecture, chart-API isolation) without needing
further comparison; (b) request a UAT pass on the interaction-shaped
questions (§34 — channel-add feel, drag interaction feel, Fit/Proportional
Y-scaling, toolbar layout); or (c) directly authorize the recommended first
implementation slice (§29: checkbox channel-add + synchronized multi-panel
display + a minimal two-button toolbar, still zero backend change). Do
**not** begin any Phase 2C implementation without one of these explicit
signals — this design pass's own closing instruction was to stop at the
proposal. Separately, resolving the abandoned-session TTL question and the
~100 MB real-file memory validation remain recommended before broader/
prolonged shared-DEV UAT, unchanged from the prior pass's own conclusion.

## What must not be assumed

- **Do not assume any part of the Phase 2C design proposal is approved** —
  every substantive choice in it (panel model, grouping, drag/reorder, the
  one-instance-per-panel architecture, Y-scaling, toolbar contents,
  implementation slicing) is `[PROPOSAL]`/`[ANALYSIS]`/`[COMPARISON]`/
  `[NEEDS UAT]`, not `[DECISION]`. Do not start implementing any of it as
  if it were already authorized.
- **Do not assume Phase 2C implementation has started** — it has not; no
  multi-channel API, no panel-model code, no drag/drop, no digital signals,
  no cursors exist anywhere in the repository as of this pass.
- **Do not assume Plotly is still "pending" or "preferred but open"** —
  it is the final, owner-selected renderer (DEC-022, unchanged, unaffected
  by this pass). uPlot remains removed; nothing in this pass reconsiders it.
- **Do not assume DEC-021 (workspace-level navigation) is superseded or
  reinterpreted by the Phase 2C design proposal** — the proposal builds on
  DEC-021, explicitly reaffirming it unweakened throughout; it does not
  replace or loosen it.
- Do not assume the recommended one-Plotly-instance-per-panel architecture
  (§16 of the design) is the only technically valid option — it's the
  evidence-based *recommendation*, reasoned from Plotly's own documented API
  surface and Phase 2B's already-proven broadcast mechanism; a future
  implementer should still sanity-check the interaction feel once built,
  per the design's own note.
- Do not assume the `powerwave`/Detego findings recorded in this pass are a
  complete audit of either product — `powerwave`'s investigation was scoped
  to the 8 specific questions this task asked (panel/reorder/resize/Y-axis/
  legend/show-hide/digital-relationship/explicit-weaknesses); Detego's
  findings are limited to what its own public marketing/docs pages state,
  not an audit of its actual authenticated application.
- Do not assume TTL or the ~100 MB validation is solved — both remain
  explicitly open, reassessed but not resolved by this pass.
- Do not assume the retained `DisturbanceRecord` (Phase 2A, DEC-019) or the
  waveform API's behavior changed this pass — zero backend files were
  touched; the existing single-channel endpoint is unchanged.
- Do not assume `Start new workspace`/`Remove` behavior changed — both are
  unchanged from DEC-018.
- Do not assume the COMTRADE upload interaction is still open for UAT — it
  is decided (DEC-017): two explicit slots, not auto-pairing.
- Do not assume Phase 1.5, Phase 2C implementation, or any later phase is
  authorized.
- Do not assume `powerwave` is still at commit `3156392` by the time you
  read this — re-verify before relying on specific line numbers (it was
  re-confirmed unchanged as of this pass, 2026-08-15).

## Owner approval needed before proceeding?

- Not needed to read/discuss the Phase 2C design proposal itself — it's
  already written up and committed for review, per this exact task's own
  authorization.
- **Yes**, before any Phase 2C implementation slice begins (including the
  recommended first slice, §29 of the design) — see "What should be done
  next" above for the specific approval paths available. Also required
  before Phase 1.5 or any later phase begins, before a PROD deployment
  (moot this pass — nothing was deployed), and before any change to the
  ephemeral-storage, upload-size, COMTRADE-upload-interaction,
  workspace-lifecycle, or waveform-data decisions recorded in
  `DECISIONS.md`. Per the change-governance rule in
  [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) / [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).
- **Recommended before any further prolonged/shared-DEV waveform UAT**: a
  real decision on the abandoned-session TTL question, and ideally the
  ~100 MB real-file memory validation, rather than continuing to rely on
  the manual DEV stopgap.
